# World Development Indicator
## ETL Project

An ETL pipeline program which ingests data from the World Bank Database,
then cleans, parses and transforms data to answer such questions as:

1. Economic Development Insights
   - **GDP vs. Electricity Access:**
     - Do countries with higher GDPs generally have better electricity access?
   - GDP Growth vs. Population Growth:
     - Are countries with rapidly growing populations experiencing corresponding GDP growth, or is there a lag?
   - **GDP and Rural Population:**
     - Investigate whether countries with a higher percentage of rural population tend to have lower GDP per capita, to highlight the possible impact of urbanization on economic development.
2. Social Development Insights
   - **Electricity Access and Population:**
     - Is there a threshold population size beyond which electricity access becomes more widespread?
   - **Rural Population Trends:**
     - Are countries becoming more urbanized? If so, how rapidly is this happening in different regions?
   - **Electricity Access in Rural Areas:**
     - Are rural areas lagging significantly behind urban areas in terms of electricity access?
3. **Regional Insights**
   - Regional GDP Disparities:
     - Compare GDP data across different regions (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe) to identify regional disparities. Which regions are growing fastest, and which are lagging behind?
   - Access to Electricity in Different Regions:
     - Are there specific regions where access to electricity has improved significantly over time?
   - Population Dynamics Across Regions:
     -  Which regions are experiencing the fastest population growth, and how might this affect their economies?
4. **Longitudinal Analysis**
   - Electricity Access Over Time:
     - Which countries have made the most progress in improving access to electricity, and what policies or factors might explain this?
   - GDP Growth Over Time:
     -  Identify periods of economic boom or recession and correlate these with significant global or regional events.
   - Urbanization Trends:
     - Is the world moving towards greater urbanization, and how does this trend vary by region?

5. **Country-Specific Insights**
   - Country Case Studies:
     - Examine how a countryâ€™s GDP, electricity access, and rural population percentage have evolved over the past few decades.
   - Identifying High Performers:
     - Identify countries that have performed exceptionally well in improving GDP, electricity access, or reducing rural populations. Study what sets these countries apart from others.
   - Challenges in Low-Income Countries:
     - Focus on low-income countries to understand the challenges they face in improving electricity access and GDP growth. What factors are holding them back?
